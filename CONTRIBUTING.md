# Contributing

Thanks for contributing to this project.

Some general guidelines:
* Unit test your code via [ShellSpec](https://github.com/shellspec/shellspec).
* Please document all functions and any non-trivial code. Keep in mind that not everyone is an expert on advanced Bash syntax.
* Use [ShellCheck](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) for static code analysis. There is a [ShellCheck extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=timonwong.shellcheck).
* Follow the Google [Shell Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/shellguide.html).
